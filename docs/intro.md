# Intro

The nature of the FIRST Robotics Competition fuses design and engineering, embracing the pillars of mechanical, electrical, and software engineering. When people join the team with an interest in software engineering, they typically concentrate solely on that field, much like my own initial approach. I thought that stretching myself thin across many aspects of robotics would worsen me as a programmer. I could not have been more wrong. After many years, I’ve now learned from experience just how important understanding the electrical and mechanical function of the robot is as a programmer. If we imagine the code as the robot's brain, it becomes clear that to maximize the movement of its limbs, the robot's brain must first understand its body. This is something that I’d learned, but didn’t come easy, and hasn't yet been emphasized enough in the team. As it stands now, I hold a vast majority of the programming knowledge, and my departure at graduation could throw the team for a loop. This is part of what I aim to solve in my project.
