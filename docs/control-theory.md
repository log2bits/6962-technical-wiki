# Control Theory
Control theory is a major part of robotics and harnesses powerful techniques that allow for precise and controlled mechanical actuation. If you have a mechanism, and you wish to have it reach a desired state, you need control theory in some way or another.

Pivoting arm? Rotating turret? Spinning flywheel? Linear elevator? All of these mechanisms require knowledge of control theory to function correctly.

## So what is it?
Simply put, control theory is a way of reading the current state of a mechanism with a sensor and then deciding how to run a motor to achieve the target state.

A Control system usually involves the following components:

1. **Reference:** Desired behavior or final condition you want the system to achieve. Otherwise known as the target state or the setpoint.

2. **Plant:** The system that you want to control.

3. **Controller:** The device or algorithm that decides the system's output based on the reference.

4. **Sensor:** Measures the current state of the plant.

5. **Feedback:** Comparison of the plant's current state to the reference, which then alters the system to help it get closer to the reference.

## Let's try an example.
Assume we have an elevator and a sensor that magically tells us how many meters along the track the elevator is currently sitting. Currently, it's reading 2 meters, but we want to get to 10 meters. This 10-meter target is the **Reference**. Okay, so what do you do? You move up, right? So you tell the motor to run at full speed, and eventually, it reaches 10 meters and stops. This is what that logic would look like:

```java
// Calculates the power (-1.0 - 1.0) sent to the motor 
// given the current measurement and target setpoint
public double calculate(double measurement, double setpoint) {
  if (setpoint < measurement) return -1.0;
  if (setpoint > measurement) return 1.0;
  return 0.0;
}
```

In an ideal world, this would work great. But we assume a few things that aren't true in the real world:

1. Sensor readings aren't instant and perfectly precise

2. Motor commands aren't instant

3. Mechanisms have inertia

4. Our software can only run so many times a second

Because of this oversight, our mechanism will likely overshoot its target, attempt to compensate, and undershoot, repeating this cycle forever. This is called an **oscillation**. The system will **oscillate** around its target state but never fully stop at it.

So what can we do?

One simple fix is to add some tolerance. Our logic only allows the motor to stop if the measurement reads EXACTLY what our target state is. With this fix, the motor will stop when its "close enough", reducing the likelihood that it skips over the setpoint.

```java
// Calculates the power (-1.0 - 1.0) sent to the motor 
// given the current measurement and target setpoint
public double calculate(double measurement, double setpoint, double tolerance) {
  if (setpoint < measurement - tolerance) return -1.0;
  if (setpoint > measurement + tolerance) return 1.0;
  return 0.0;
}
```

Congratulations! We've just made a **Bang-Bang Controller**! This is the most simple of all control system algorithms and has many flaws.

## A new idea.
The primary problem with Bang-Bang Controllers is that they have no sense of motor speed, and maximize the output power in any situation. This is a problem because you get very jerky and unpredictable movement, and we often overshoot our target state, requiring a lower tolerance than we'd like.

A simple solution to this would be to slow down the motor speed as we get closer to our setpoint, something like this:

```java
// Calculates the power (-1.0 - 1.0) sent to the motor 
// given the current measurement and target setpoint
public double calculate(double measurement, double setpoint) {
  double error = measurement - setpoint;
  return error;
}
```

This takes the error (measurement - setpoint) and uses that as the motor power. If the error is small, the motor will run slower. If the error is negative, the motor will run backward.

This works in some cases, but depending on the unit of measurement, we get vastly different results. For example, if the measurement and setpoint are measured in motor rotations, the motor will be given full power only a single rotation away from the setpoint, essentially turning this into a Bang-Bang Controller again. The opposite is true as well. Given a really large unit, you end up with the motor ramping down too early, resulting in a less-than-optimal response time.

## Proportional Term
To compensate for different types of systems with different units and different magnitudes of speeds and inertia, we introduce a **Proportional Term**. By *term*, I just mean an additional parameter that decides how this control system behaves.

This term acts as a scaling factor for the error, simply multiplying the error by the term results in the output motor power, like so:

```java
// Calculates the power (-1.0 - 1.0) sent to the motor 
// given the current measurement and target setpoint
public double calculate(double measurement, double setpoint, double kP) {
  double error = measurement - setpoint;
  return error * kP;
}
```

This acts as a tuning parameter to adjust the system's responsiveness. If the error is large, the result of the multiplication by Kp is also large, resulting in a large adjustment and faster approach towards the setpoint. If the error is small, the response is less intense, allowing the system to approach the setpoint more gently with less chance of overshooting.

However, a P controller alone can still fall short in two main scenarios:

1. **Steady-state error**: In some circumstances, a proportional controller will still have a residual error at steady state, meaning that the system doesn't perfectly reach the target. This is due to the fact that as the error decreases, the control action decreases proportionally and may not be enough to overcome system disturbances or friction.

2. **Overshoot**: While the proportional controller reduces the chances of overshooting compared to the previous controllers, it does not entirely eliminate it. Large values of Kp, while responsive, increase the likelihood of overshooting the setpoint.

## Derivative and Integral Term
To compensate for overshoot, we can introduce a new term, the derivative term. This term uses the rate of change (slope) of the error to compensate for the predicted future error. You can imagine this as a "damping" factor, which smooths out quick changes in the error, preventing overshoots. Make this term too high though, and you end up with too much damping, resulting in a controller that takes too long to reach the setpoint. 

The math behind this term gets a little complicated, so we'll move over to using the existing [PIDController](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/advanced-controls/controllers/pidcontroller.html) class that's part of the WPILib library that handles the math for us. 

The final term is the Integral term, which uses the integral of the error to compensate for the past. This term is rarely used because of how unpredictable it may be, as it accumulates over time, and can grow quickly.

## All together
**P** ***(Proportion)***: Compensates based on the present  
**I** ***(Integral)***: Compensates based on the past  
**D** ***(Derivative)***: Compensates based on the future  

## Velocity Control
This all works great for position control (elevators, arms, etc) but what about velocity control?

Velocity control is very important, arguably as important than position control, but just wont work with a simple PID controller. This is because PID controllers assume that with an output of zero, the state will stay the same, but if our desired state is in units of velocity, an output of zero will always bring us back to zero velocity, taking us away from our desired state. The best way to combat this is to use Feedforward Control.

## Feedforward Control
Feedforward control is a mechanism that improves the performance of our control system based on the predictable behaviors or disturbances in the controlled plant. Unlike the PID controllers that we've discussed, which rely on feedback (past behavior), feedforward control uses a model of the plant to predict its future behavior.

Imagine you are driving on a highway, and you see a hill up ahead. You could wait until the car starts to slow down, then step on the gas (this would be feedback, like a PID controller). Or, knowing that the hill will slow down the car, you could give it more gas in advance to maintain the same speed. This proactive approach is how feedforward control works.

Applying this to velocity control, we can use a model of our motor (often provided by the motor manufacturer) to predict the power needed to reach a particular speed and add that to our PID output.

```java
public double calculate(double measurement, double setpoint, double kP, double kF) {
  double error = measurement - setpoint;
  double feedforward = kF * setpoint;
  return error * kP + feedforward;
}
```

In this example, `kF` is a new term, the Feedforward Term. This term directly scales from the setpoint, so if we have a setpoint of 2000 RPM (rotations per minute) for instance, it calculates the power needed for that desired speed. So, instead of begging the system to go faster with a higher error and higher ï»¿kP term, we tell it upfront the power it needs thereby making it more efficient and reducing error.

To obtain the correct `kF` term for the given scenario we, unfortunately, need to do some experimenting. The easiest method is to run your motor at full power (1.0), measure the resulting speed, and take the reciprocal of this. This should give you a good starting point for `kF`.

## Additional Feedforward Term
While using `kF` will get you quite far, sometimes an additional term is required, the `kS` term. This term is to overcome the friction in the system that might prevent the motor from turning in low velocity situations. For example, if we try to run a motor at 1% speed, and it's rigged to a gearbox, the friction of the gears will likely prevent it from moving at all. This is where the `kS` term comes in. When adding a small `kS` term, that value is added to the output to overcome the friction in the system.

## Using WPILib
This is what all of this looks like using WPILib:

```java
// Define MOTOR_ID, kP, kI, kD, kS, kV

CANSparkMax motor;
RelativeEncoder encoder; // Read the docs on sensors if you want to understand encoders
PIDController controller;
SimpleMotorFeedforward feedforward;

motor = new CANSparkMax(MOTOR_ID);
encoder = motor.getEncoder();
controller = new PIDController(
  kP, 
  kI, 
  kD
);
feedforward = new SimpleMotorFeedforward(
  kS,
  kV
);

public void runVelocityControl(double targetVelocity) {
  motor.set(
    feedforward.calculate(targetVelocity) + 
    controller.calculate(encoder.getVelocity(), targetVelocity)
  );
}

public void runPositionControl(double targetPosition) {
  motor.set(controller.calculate(encoder.getPosition(), targetPosition));
}
```

## Advanced Control Theory
More advanced algorithms such as Kalman Filters and Trapazoidal Profiles are very useful, and documented here: https://docs.wpilib.org/en/2022/docs/software/advanced-controls/index.html
